# cv-app

cv-app is a web application built with Vite, React, and Chakra UI that allows users to create their CV (Curriculum Vitae) by filling out three different forms: General Info, Education Info, and Experience Info. Once the user fills out any of these forms and submits them, the CV on the side gets updated accordingly.
